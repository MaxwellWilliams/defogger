Defogger Project SRS Evaluation
===============================

Nice job on this, a very good document.

This is an interesting project, but it needs a bit more "meat" in these
specifications.  The way it's written, it's a bit too vague.  The intro
is good, stating fsuccinctly what the project does.  However, examples
of what I mean by "more meat":

in 5.2.1.1 you specify "general analysis shall run ...... same format."

what is meant by "same format"?  What *IS* the format?

in 5.2.1.3 you specify "general analysis shall provide reusable code"

what is meant by "reusable"?  What *IS* the reusable on?

These are "philosophy of requirements" issues that you can apply in a
*general* way to nearly all the requirements in the document.  However,
in the essence of time remaining, I'm assigning full credit to this
deliverable, for both the initial and the final submissions.

You don't have to do anything further with this document if you don't
feel the need to do so.

Deliverable D-02: 15% out of 15% = 100% which is an A-plus
Deliverable D-05:  5% out of  5% = 100% which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!
