Defogger is a data science and machine learning based project that will provide insight into the past, present, and future trends of a dataset.  The data source being used is yet to be determined, but will most likely focus on crime data from the LAPD, city census data, or flu data.  Software such as Pandas, tensorflow, jupyter notebooks, and a database are expected to be used, and additional processing power may be required for advanced modeling and prediction.

This project is justified for this class because it meets all key requirements.  The storing, manipulation, and analysis of the data will require use of knowledge from classes such as data structures, algorithms, and databases.  Additionally, this project will involve machine learning and elements of data science which will challenge and expand my current understanding.  The large quantity of data involved in this project will be analyzed in many ways to find any possible correlations, which will require thorough and repeatable analysis which will be challenging and time intensive.  The combination of all these characteristics and my interest in expanding my knowledge of the subject make this project justified for this class.
